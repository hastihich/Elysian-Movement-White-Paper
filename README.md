Abstract
The Elysian Movement is a groundbreaking fusion of ancient Iranian philosophy, body performance art, and Web 3 technologies, focusing on preserving and modernizing cultural wisdom through digital platforms like NFTs. By tokenizing live performances as interactive, tradable digital assets, the movement creates an innovative space where art, philosophy, and technology converge. Elysian Movement aims to empower artists to retain control over their works, engage a global audience, and ensure cultural legacies are passed on through decentralized systems.

Introduction
The Elysian Movement represents a philosophical and artistic endeavor aimed at reconnecting modern audiences with the deep cultural roots of ancient Iranian wisdom and body performance art. By combining Eastern philosophy and modern digital platforms like NFTs, the project transforms live performances into timeless digital collectibles. We live in a world where art, culture, and philosophy are increasingly commodified, often losing their inherent value in the process. The Elysian Movement seeks to address this by offering a decentralized platform where body performance becomes a lasting digital legacy. Our project leverages the power of Web 3 technologies to provide artists and audiences with a space to create, share, and interact with art in new and meaningful ways.

Problem Statement
In an increasingly digital world, traditional performance art is often restricted by physical boundaries, temporal limitations, and a lack of sustainable monetization models. Performers struggle to retain long-term ownership of their work, and the audience's experience remains fleeting. Ancient cultural wisdom, especially from Eastern societies like Iran, risks fading away as modernity takes center stage. There is a need for a platform that enables:
•	Preservation of cultural and philosophical heritage in the form of modern digital art.
•	Ownership and long-term interaction with performance art, transcending the limits of time and space.
•	Fair and sustainable monetization for creators and performers. By embracing Web 3 technologies, the Elysian Movement addresses these challenges through NFTs and blockchain-based interactions.

Vision of Elysian Movement
The Elysian Movement is an exploration of how ancient Iranian philosophy and art can converge with modern digital tools to create a unique form of artistic expression. Through body performance, artists express profound philosophical truths, drawing upon ancient myths, legends, and rituals.
Key Elements:
•	Philosophy and Performance: The body becomes a canvas for ancient wisdom, allowing performers to embody the spiritual and philosophical insights of Eastern cultures.
•	NFTs as Art: By tokenizing live performances, the movement transforms art into digital assets that collectors and audiences can own, trade, and interact with.
•	Global Community: Web 3 allows for a decentralized global audience, breaking down barriers and bringing artists and enthusiasts together in a shared digital space.

Web 3 and NFTs Integration
Web 3 technologies, particularly blockchain and NFTs, offer new possibilities for performance artists. The Elysian Movement leverages these technologies to allow body performance art to exist as a digital asset.
Key Components:
1.	Tokenization of Performance Art: Every live performance within the Elysian Movement is recorded and transformed into an NFT. These NFTs represent a digital version of the performance, complete with metadata describing its cultural and philosophical significance.
2.	Ownership and Tradability: By owning an Elysian NFT, collectors can possess a piece of history, rooted in ancient Iranian culture. These NFTs can be traded on decentralized marketplaces, ensuring that the art maintains its value over time.
3.	Smart Contracts: Smart contracts ensure that every time an NFT is sold or traded, a percentage of the revenue is automatically returned to the original artist. This creates a sustainable royalty model for performers.
4.	Interactive NFTs: Future phases of the Elysian Movement will introduce interactive elements to the NFTs, allowing them to change or evolve based on user engagement or external factors like weather conditions.

Technological Framework
The technical foundation of the Elysian Movement is built upon established blockchain technologies, enabling decentralization, security, and transparency. The following elements form the core of the movement’s infrastructure:
Blockchain Integration
•	The Elysian Movement uses the Tezos blockchain through the Objkt platform for minting and managing NFTs.
•	The Tezos blockchain ensures transparency, scalability, and energy efficiency, making it an ideal choice for sustainable and secure NFT creation.
•	Objkt serves as the primary marketplace for showcasing and trading Elysian Movement NFTs, allowing for decentralized, censorship-resistant distribution and ownership.
Smart Contracts
•	Smart contracts automatically manage the sale and trading of Elysian NFTs, ensuring that creators receive a fair share of royalties each time an NFT is resold.
•	These contracts are self-executing, reducing the need for intermediaries and ensuring trustless transactions.
Decentralized Platforms
•	The Elysian Movement operates on Objkt, a decentralized marketplace built on the Tezos blockchain. Objkt offers a robust platform for minting, managing, and trading NFTs in a sustainable and scalable manner.
•	Tezos is chosen for its energy-efficient, secure, and scalable infrastructure, aligning with the values of the Elysian Movement to promote environmental consciousness and decentralized ownership.
•	By leveraging Objkt and Tezos, the Elysian Movement ensures that all transactions, art ownership, and interactions remain decentralized, transparent, and accessible to a global audience.
•	The white paper and other related materials will be hosted on decentralized storage systems like IPFS, ensuring long-term availability without reliance on centralized servers.

Use Cases
The Elysian Movement has the potential to impact various sectors, from the arts to cultural preservation. Some of the primary use cases include:
1.	Cultural Preservation
•	The performances capture and preserve ancient Iranian philosophical ideas, ensuring they are passed on to future generations through digital art.
2.	Global Artistic Community
•	By decentralizing the distribution of performance art, the Elysian Movement connects artists, collectors, and enthusiasts worldwide. The global reach is crucial for fostering cross-cultural dialogues.
3.	Monetization of Performance Art
•	Traditional performance art struggles with sustainability. By creating NFTs, performers can generate income even after a live event, ensuring long-term financial stability.
